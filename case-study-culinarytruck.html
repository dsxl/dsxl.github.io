                                                <p>It was August of 2013 and I had just purchased a new GoPro Hero 3 that I couldn't wait to use. The next day, I was flying out to Costa Rica on an adventure tour.</p>
                                                <p>I remember sitting on the flight over to San Jose Airport and I couldn't sit still. Adrenaline was flowing through me, I had a tingling sensation of all the adventures ahead of me. It was uncontrollable, my mind was exploding with ideas of where I can put that camera for the most unique perspectives I could think of.</p>
                                                <p>Upon arriving in Costa Rica, I was the most awkward tourist you could come across. I had to take pictures of everything and everyone. I was on the streets squatting and rolling on the floor for that right shot. It was ridiculous but I'd do it all over again.</p>
                                                <p>We went fishing in Puerto Jiménez, on the Osa Peninsula. It was a beautiful town that enjoyed life without technology. Watching the sunset in the West when we went horseback riding to the top of the mountain, clearing paths with a machete to get some fresh coconuts and sugar cane, watching whales jump out of the water, and seeing insects the size of Pokémon were some of the memories I will always have of that place.</p>
                                                <p>However, that truly special moment didn't happen until later on in the trip.</p>
                                                <p>During the last few days of our trip, we went to Arenal Volcano. We didn't have any set plans, it was just an interesting site we wanted to visit.</p>
                                                <p>The drive there was a story in itself, involving record-breaking rainfall, massive landslides and us getting on Costa Rica's national news TV when we needed directions amidst the chaos in a small village.</p>
                                                <p>We toured the volcano site and had no idea it was home to one of the world's most intense zip-lines. All tours for that day were sold out. But as fate would have it, one of the instructors that were last to go up offered me his spot and gear, it even had a GoPro mount on his helmet. It was meant to be.</p>
                                                <p>I was the only one in the gondola riding to the top to meet the rest of the group, who were patiently waiting for me, thanks guys!</p>
                                                <p>After introductions and safety, we would set of on eight zip-line routes that would take us back down the mountain base. Top speeds of 55 MPH and drops of 550+ feet below you, this was a thrill of a lifetime.</p>
                                                <p>I befriended two guys that were Miami locals and adrenaline junkies. We instantly bonded and exchanged stories about the different adventures we had been on.</p>
                                                <p>We had just finished the fourth route, the fastest one that caps out at 55 MPH. Our hands shaking from adrenaline and excitement. We were all coming in hot and crashing into the safety pads. Without hesitation, I and my two adrenaline junkies hopped over to get on the next line. Told the guide that we should not wait for the others. He asked us why? I looked at one of the guys and in harmony we said:</p>
                                                <blockquote class="blockquote">
                                                    <div class="icon"><img src="images/icons/quote.png" alt=""></div>
                                                    keep the rush going.
                                                </blockquote>
                                                <p>It was in that moment, it all felt so blissful. I had been saying that phrase for years to my family and friends and they didn't get it. To share a moment in harmony with someone else that got it was amazing.</p>
                                                <p>From that point, the idea to KEEP THE RUSH GOING project was born. </p>
                                                <p>To inspire others to adventure out into the unknown. To live outside your comfort zone. To truly feel alive instead of just being alive.</p>
                                                <p>I hope my story inspires others to get out there and see this beautiful home we call Earth.</p>
